The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), who has previously published [Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec5) and a [Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), has published a [Privacy Framework](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework). This framework is useful when developing new products and services to ensure something important hasn't been overlooked, as well as for auditing existing solutions.
