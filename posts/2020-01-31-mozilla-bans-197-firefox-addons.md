Over the past two weeks, Mozilla has banned nearly 200 Firefox add-ons that were caught executing malicious code, stealing user data, or using obfuscation to hide their behavior. These add-ons have been banned and removed from the add-on store, and removed from the browsers of users that have already installed them.

129 of the 197 add-ons were developed by "2Ring", a provider of business-to-business software, and were removed because they were found to be downloading and running code from a remote server. This practice is forbidden because it is significantly harder for automatic scanning of such add-ons, and provides no guarantee that the add-on won't have malicious code added in the future.
